  "content": "&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-title center-text&quot;&gt;Climate Record&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bernie is one of the fiercest fighters for recognition of, adaptation to, and mitigation of climate change. Few have the resolve, clarity of understanding, and guts to both stand up against global warming in Washington and play a strong role at local and neighborhood levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Does Bernie have experience on physical science committees in the Senate?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes. Bernie has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sanders.senate.gov/about/committees&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;served on key Senate committees&lt;/a&gt; such as the &ldquo;Environment and Public Works&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Energy and Natural Resources&rdquo; committees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Fair enough. But how does Bernie stack up to other senators in terms of work on climate change?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SuperPAC &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.climatehawksvote.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Climate Hawks Vote&lt;/a&gt;, whose mission is to bring attention and praise to those who prioritize and speak on the climate crisis, consistently gives Bernie a terrific &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.climatehawksvote.com/look_up_vt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;scorecard&lt;/a&gt;. Importantly, Climate Hawks Vote measures leadership, not just voting records, tabulating actions like bills introduced, speeches given, and so forth. Notably, the organization put Bernie in the top 10 percent of senators in 2011/12, the top senator in 2013/14, and in the top 10 percent in 2015/16. Bernie also has the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.commondreams.org/views/2015/04/30/why-planet-happy-bernie-sanders-running-president&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;outspoken support&lt;/a&gt; of respected author and environmentalist Bill McKibben.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2014, Bernie attended the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.democracynow.org/2014/9/22/bernie_sanders_at_peoples_climate_march&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;People&amp;#8217;s Climate March&lt;/a&gt; in New York City. Watch him speak about how the influence of money in politics negatively impacts the fight to address climate change:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;embed-responsive-item&quot; src=&quot;http://www.democracynow.org/embed/story/2014/9/22/bernie_sanders_at_peoples_climate_march&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;center-text caption&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How well does Bernie understand the issues around and science behind climate change?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bernie regularly demonstrates his ability to understand the science and strongly argue with climate skeptics, and is clearly not just providing talking points for headlines. When speaking about the issue, as seen in the following video from 2014 &mdash; just one of many, many instances of Bernie dropping science in Congress about climate change&mdash;, he regularly cites scientific findings and uses scientific language:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;embed-responsive-item&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YpJh1xtg28I&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;center-text caption&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"
